                    <p>My workflow is always evloving as I look to be more efficient while building and maintaining large bodies of code. Currently I work on a Windows 7 machine with Google Chrome as my develpment browser, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3" target="_blank">Sublime Text III</a> as my text editor of choice, <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp.js</a> as my automated task runner, and various ruby gems to handle things like image compression and SASS watching. <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">Xampp</a> is currently my IDE of choice (previously Microsoft Webmatrix), which I choose because it is light and works well out of the box. I build everything mobile first using Chrome Remote Debugging, Browserstack, and <a href="https://github.com/shakyShane/browser-sync" target="_blank">Browser-Sync</a>. This setup enables me to make sure nothing is missed, and the user gets a great experience on all devices.</p>

                    <p>First and foremost, my goal is to make the web better. I aim to make sure it works first and looks cool second. I intend to make sure it isn't cluttered, the focus is put on its well crafted meaningful content, and it doesn't decieve or take advantage of anyone. It's very important to me that everyone can use it, with any device, having any disability, and no matter where they are from or how strong their internet connection is.</p>
                    <p> I enjoy making templates, tools, and websites for small and large clients, no matter the business they are in. I like some backend stuff, but front end stuff is my passion.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the day, it all comes down to my love for problem solving. That's why I'm here, doing this, drinking so much coffee. If you have a web problem, let me know, I'd like to help you solve it.</p>
