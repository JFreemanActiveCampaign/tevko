Travle Impressions creates hundreds of landing pages every week. These are used to advertise hotel and resort deals to travel agents, who then sell those deals to their customers. The initial problem with these landing pages was that they were built with outdated technology, and they weren't responsive, which can be very unhelpful for email marketing campaigns.

In order to solve these problems, I suggested using a content management system to help build and organize all of the landing pages, to which we would build a modern and responsive user interface. Using Concrete5 as the choosen CMS, a great design provided by Travel Impressions in house graphic designers, and an awesome backend team to set up the server environment, I was able to build a very well functioning front end for this project, which consisted of several different templates for a variety of landing page styles.
